* Computational Physics

This repo contains a collection of my implementations for numerical 
algorithms & visualizations from the field of computational physics.

** Contents
As of yet, I have (only) uploaded the following projects:
- [[https://github.com/vincentmader/double-pendulum.py][Integration of the equations of motion for a double-pendulum (RK4)]]
- [[https://github.com/vincentmader/random-walk_live-plot.py][2D random walk visualization in matplotlib-liveplot]]

More to come in the future...

** Setup
To be able to download these projects all at once, run
#+begin_src shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vincentmader/computational-physics
#+end_src shell
from your shell. The `--recurse-submodules` flag can also be used with the `git pull` 
command, if you want to get the newest changes to the repository at some point later on.
