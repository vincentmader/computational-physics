* Computational Physics

This repo contains a collection of my implementations for numerical 
algorithms & visualizations from the field of computational physics.

As of yet, I have (only) uploaded the following projects:
- [[https://github.com/vincentmader/double-pendulum.py][integration of the eqs. of motion for a double-pendulum (RK4)]]

More to come in the future...
